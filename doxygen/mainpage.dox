@section instructions @fa{hammer} Build Instructions

@subsection cmake With CMake:

@code{.sh}
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
@endcode

@subsection common Common

If you have *libcheck* installed you can compile the test suite which you can
run using the ``check`` target.

CMake will auto detect *OpenSSL* and *GnuTLS* and use one or both. There are
CMake options to force either one on or off.
